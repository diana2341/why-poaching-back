population:"less than 3,800 ",
status:"Endangered",lifespan:"up to 19 years",
name:"Tiger",
causes:"Wild tigers' main threat is poaching(illegal hunting).They are hunted for their body parts, their bones, skin,and meat.
 They are high in demand and are made into various products that are used throughout countries in Asia and Great Britain. They are used for medical purposes, 
 it is thought that each body part has different curing effects and are thought to calm fright and cure ulcers, bites, rheumatism, laziness,pimples, to ward off evil spirits. 
 Chinese government banned the use of tiger parts in the 1990s, there is  strong cultural belief in tiger parts helping to treat these diseases or problems. Because of this there is still high demand on tiger parts.
 They are also used as status symbols, their skins used as home decor like carpets, they are used to make  wine , and to keep as pets or to eat . In these countries, a pair of tiger eyes can sell for $170 , a paw $1000. 
 Tiger bone may be sold in powdered form for anywhere between $64-$168/lb , tiger wine known to be sold for over $30,000 a case and their pelt (skin) could also be sold at $20,000.
",
help:"When traveling donâ€™t purchase any product that could contain animal parts. 
There are many conservation organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) that are working to stop and prevent animal poaching, you can help by  signing a petition or donating to their organization.
You can even start by  spreading the word and educating  others about the illegal trade of tigers and informing them on how we are losing them.
